SEQUENCING METADATA
=====================

Metadata must be stored as a CSV file that meets the following requirements:
Unicode text encoding
Unix (LF) newlines/line breaks
There are no SPACES, COLONS, COMMAS, or PARENTHESES

You can check that your file doesn’t contain any weirdness by opening it with a plain text editor like TextWrangler (in TextWrangler, the bottom bar should display the current text encoding and newline/linebreaks).

*NOTE!*: Every time you open the file in Excel for Mac (even if you don’t change anything), it will change newline characters to Classic Mac (CR). Every time you open the file in LibreOffice Calc, it will add quotes.



# Columns that should be included in sequencing metadata
sample_id : think of this as the sample with respect to sequencing, not environmental
locus
library_index
library_name
primer1_name
primer1_sequence_core
primer1_index_name
primer1_index_sequence
primer1_sequence_full
primer2_name
primer2_sequence_core
primer2_index_name
primer2_index_sequence
interprimer_size_min
interprimer_size_max
interprimer_size_mean
env_sample_name
DNA_extraction_name
PCR_name
project : useful for combining multiple projects per run (e.g. grid, spatial)

environmental data:
env_sample_name
date_collected
time_collected
latitude
longitude
?tidal_height
?salinity
?temp
?habitat
?distance_from_shore


from an existing file:
order    sample_id    library_tag_combo    lib_primer_index    library    tag_sequence    sample_name    experiment    dist_from_shore    transect    PCR_replicate    sample_type

move these fields to a "library_prep_worksheet"
