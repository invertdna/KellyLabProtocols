 So you're aware of the changes to our protocol, I've switched to a new KAPA kit which is faster and only requires 1-2 bead cleanups, and am using more input DNA and am skipping size selection and library amplification. The size and yields look good based off running on a gel, but I am troubleshooting the presence of a second smaller band which has been present before and likely represents inefficient ligation but is stronger with these libraries. Just waiting on a response from KAPA. 

Also, I now have a quantification kit to more accurately quantify the libraries, it's a qPCR assay and ran it for the first time yesterday. This assay only quantifies adapter ligated DNA as opposed to Qubit or Bioanalyzer which will quantify any DNA that makes it through the prep (e.g. unligated amplicon, partially ligated amplicon, adapter dimer). This is important as an accurate starting concentration ensures good cluster density on the flowcell when sequencing.
