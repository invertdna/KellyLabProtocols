Notes on Library preparation for a MiSeq run

Step 1: PCR1 is a PCR reaction with universal primers: same primer pair for all samples.
  Currently PCR1 is performed on 20 ul Rx, while only 1 ul is transferred to PCR2,
  so there is potential to reduce the Volume to 15 or 10 ul.
  PCR mix includes extra MgCl2 for COI and  16S loci.
COI cycling includes a touchdown approach from 62-46 and 25 more cycles at 


Mix per well:

72- 10min



Step 2: Check PCR success in a gel: 5 ul PCR with 1 ul of Loading dye + Sybr Green
Step 3: AMPure XP with successful amplicons:
        IF PCR VOLUME IS 10 UL, USE 8.3 uL of PCR product and 15 uL of AMPURE XP
        and elute in 20 uL of PCR water.
        IF PCR VOLUME IS 20 UL, USE 11.0 uL of PCR product and 20 uL of AMPURE XP
        and elute in 25 ul of PCR water.
Step 4: PCR2 with sample-specific primers. Using our R script or any other randomizing tool,
 randomly assign PCR2 tags and Library adapters to each PCR replicate. PCR2 is on a 25 uL volume, adding between 2 - 5 uL of
 PCR1 product as template. Mix is dispensed without primers, and then add 1 uL of the sample specific primer pair on each well.

Mix per well:

PCR water						15.375	
10x buffer						2.5	
25mM MgCl2						1	
dNTPs (8mM)						1	
primer 1 and 2 (10 µM)					1	
HotStar Taq						0.125	
Template						4

95C - 15min
95C - 15 sec	|
62-46 - 30sec	|
72 - 1 min	|x16
95C - 15 sec	|
46 - 30sec	|
72 - 1 min	|x6
72- 10min


Step 5: AMPure XP all samples. Use  15 ul of PCR product and 20 ul of AMPure XP per sample, to reduce
  the carryover of unassigned tags. Elute in 20 ul of PCR water.
Step 5.5: Qubit purified products.

Step 6: If using PCR2 to assign tags to samples, run the script that uses vol_for_sequencing to calculate
  how much of each sample you want to pool. I recommend targeting 150-250 ng of DNA into each well in the next
  step. I diluted the PCR2 products 10:100 to be more accurate while pooling.
Step 7: Do the End Repair and A-tailing Rx.  So for each library I used:
      250 ng DNA in 50 ul
      3 ul Enzyme (x 12.1 = 36.3)
      7 ul Buffer (x 12.1 = 84.7)
      


      Run KapaEND on Thermocycler

Step 8: Do the Adapter ligation RX: For 250 ng of DNA, the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit recommends a Adapter conc
  of 750 nM, which is close to adding 5 ul of the 15 uM Stock into a 110 ul Rx. Make sure you add the right
  adapter to each well ;). The Rx per well is
    60 ul from Step 7 (the rx is done on the same tube)
    45 ul of a mix of Ligase (10ul), Buffer (30ul) and Water (5ul)
     5 ul of each Barcode-Library (IDT, 15uM ).

     Run KapaADAP on Thermocycler

Step 9: Post ligation AMPure Cleanup: Each library is still cleaned up independently:
    Add to the same tube 88 ul of AMPure XP
    Do the wash ups with 200 ul of 80% EtOH
    Elute in 25 ul of PCR water

Step 9b: take 1 uL of each library and run them in a Bioanalyzer - if yields are way too low,
   then increase the number of cycles of step 10

Step 10: Use 20 uL of the elution as template for a PCR with the adapters as primers
    20uL eluted libraries
    25uL 2x Kapa HiFi Hotstar Readymix
     5uL 10x KAPA library Amplification Primer mix
Step 11: Modify KapaAMP adjusting the number of cycles between 2-6, based on 9b.

Step 12: CLean up the amplified libraries. Here I have changed things a bit, based on
past failed attempts. There is a chance that Library ligation and PCR form a lot of adapter dimer.
6 PCR cycles should provide lots of Illumina-ready libraries, so there is plenty of template to spare.
My approach now is to do the Cleanup on half of the volume of each library :
    25uL libraries
    25uL PCR water
    50uL AMPure beads

    Use 200 ul of 80% Ethanol for the washes, elute in 25 uL of PCR Water

Step 13: Use 1 uL of each cleaned library in a Bioanalyzer chip: If there is a small bump in the
200bp region that is adapter dimer, which will mess up your concentration estimations for loading the libraries.
If that is the case, repeat the cleanup with the other 25 uL of libraries, this time using less beads(40uL) and same
volume of water - that will get rid of the smaller fragment while keeping enough of each library. Repeat the Bioanalyzer
chip to be sure.

Run 2 uL of each library for a Qubit quantification, and then pool libraries
to ensure equal representation of each library.

Qubit returns ng/uL

Fragment size for COI libraries is:
Amplicon:                                            313 bp
Primers+ barcodes + 3Ns : (27 + 27 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3)=  72 bp
Adapters: 122:                                       122 bp
TOTAL:                                               507 bp

So the molecular weight of the fragment is 660*507= 334,620 gr/mol

Now the conversion between ng/uL to nM is

Conc_in_ng_uL
-------------  x 10 = Conc_in_nM
   3.346


Target is 4nM, so the target concentration is ~  1.34 ng/uL - work out dilution
of each sample

It is best practice to do this final dilution in a two step process:

Calculate how much water to add to 2.5 uL of library to make it 10nM,

(n+2.5)*10 = 2.5 * [Conc_in_nM]

     [Conc_in_nM]
n = ------------- - 2.5
          4


Then, mix well all libries and make the final 4nM dilution

(n+5 )* 4 = 5 * [10]

n = 50/4 - 5

n = 7.5

So mix 5 uL of each library at 10nM with 7.5 uL of PCR water.

You can also qubit any of the mid steps for reassurance.

Given that Qubit has higher precision on the mid values of its reading,

if you are qubiting the 10nM step, that's 3.3 ng/uL.

volume in Qubit   Expected reading in qubit

1 ---------------  16
2 ---------------  33
3 ---------------  49
4 ---------------  66
5 ---------------  80
10 -------------- 160


So I'll go with 4 uL of sample in the Qubit.
