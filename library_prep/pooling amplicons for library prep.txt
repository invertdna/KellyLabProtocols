Jesse wants 400 ng DNA total per library prep "in case a library fails for any reason and needs to be redone."

therefore, for 25 samples (tags), there should be 16 ng of each sample

Make sure to quantify the entire POOL before sending to Jesse! It'd be best for him to get a known conc AND volume...
