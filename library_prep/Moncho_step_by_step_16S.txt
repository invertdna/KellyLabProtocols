Notes on Library preparation for a MiSeq run

Step 1: PCR1 is a PCR reaction with unversal primers: same primer pair for all samples.
  Currently PCR1 is performed on 20 ul Rx, while only 1 ul is transferred to PCR2,
  so there is potential to reduce the Volume to 15 or 10 ul.
  PCR mix includes extra MgCl2 for COI and  16S loci
Step 2: Check PCR success in a gel: 5 ul PCR with 1 ul of Loading dye + Sybr Green
Step 3: AMPure XP with successful amplicons:
        IF PCR VOLUME IS 10 UL, USE 8.3 uL of PCR product and 15 uL of AMPURE XP
        and elute in 20 uL of PCR water.
        IF PCR VOLUME IS 20 UL, USE 11.0 uL of PCR product and 20 uL of AMPURE XP
        and elute in 25 ul of PCR water.
Step 3.5: Qubit purified products to so yo add a similar amount of DNA to PCR2
Step 4: PCR2 with sample-specific primers. This step is under scrutiny now, as they seem
  to be mixed or mislabelled or both. If we still do it, we have to run all samples through
  the script random_tag.r (or similar) which randonmly assigns tags and libraries to samples.
  Note: modify the script to ensure the number of samples per library is as constant as possible.
  Currently PCR2 is done on a 20 ul volume.
Step 5: AMPure XP all samples. Use  15 ul of PCR product and 20 ul of AMPure XP per sample, to reduce
  the carryover of unassigned tags. Elute in 20 ul of PCR water.
Step 5.5: Qubit purified products.
Step 6: If using PCR2 to assign tags to samples, run the script that uses vol_for_sequencing to calculate
  how much of each sample you want to pool. I recommend targeting 150-250 ng of DNA into each well in the next
  step. I diluted the PCR2 products 10:100 to be more accurate while pooling.
Step 7: Do the End Repair and A-tailing Rx.  So for each library I used:
      100 ng DNA
      3 ul Enzyme
      7 ul Buffer
      PCR water to total Volume of 60 ul

      Run KapaEND on Thermocycler

Step 8: Do the Adapter ligation RX: For 100 ng of DNA, the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit recommends a Adapter:insert ratio
  of 100:1 , which is close to adding 6.6 ul of the 15 uM Stock into a 110 ul Rx. Make sure you add the right
  adapter to each well ;). The Rx per well is
    60 ul from Step 7 (the rx is done on the same well)
  43.4 ul of a mix of Ligase (10), Buffer (30) and Water (3.4)
   6.6 ul of each Barcode-Library (Bioo Scientific).

     Run KapaADAP on Thermocycler. We let it run at 20C overnight, which might be an overkill.
     Protocol recommends up to 4 hr at 20 and then 4C

Step 9: Post ligation AMPure Cleanup: Each library is still cleaned up independently:
    Add to the same tube 88 ul of AMPure XP
    Do the wash ups with 200 ul of 80% EtOH
    Elute in 25 ul of PCR water

Step 9b: take 1 uL of each library and run them in a Bioanalyzer - if yields are way too low,
   then increase the number of cycles of step 10

Step 10: Use 20 uL of the elution as template for a PCR with the adapters as primers
    20uL eluted libraries
    25uL 2x Kapa HiFi Hotstar Readymix
     5uL 10x KAPA library Amplification Primer mix
Step 11: Modify KapaAMP adjusting the number of cycles between 2-6, based on 9b

Step 12: CLean up the amplified libraries
    50uL libraries
    50uL AMPure beads

    Use 200 ul of 80% Ethanol for the washes, elute in 25 uL of PCR Water

Step 13: Use 2 uL of each library for a Qubit quantification, and then pool libraries
to ensure equal representation of each library.

Qubit returns ng/uL

Fragment size for COI libraries is:
Amplicon+ PCR primers:                               161 bp
PCR Tags + 3Ns : ( 6 + 6 + 3 + 3)=                    18 bp
Adapters: 121:                                       121 bp
TOTAL:                                               300 bp

So the molecular weight of the fragment is 660*300= 198,000 gr/mol

Now the conversion between ng/uL to nM is

Conc_in_ng_uL
-------------  x 10 = Conc_in_nM
   1.98

Target is 4nM, so the target concentration is ~ 1.6 ng/uL - work out dilution
of each sample








Run each library with the Bioanalyzer: SHIT
