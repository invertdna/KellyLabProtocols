Protocol for ligation of two DNA strands
========================================

Adapted from Gary Longo's original protocol by Jimmy O'Donnell

Notes:
	- Protocol as written starts with approx. 5000 - 9000 ng of DNA in solution.
	- rATP needed to power the DNA ligase
	- initial fragments should have blunt ends, so if using amplicons, they must first be blunt-ended
	- written for adding P2 adapters (proprietary <?> Illumina sequencing adapters), but could work for other sequences to be annealed/ligated in double stranded form

1. Add A-overhangs to the fragments by adding *in order* the following reagents to the sample. Total volume: 50 ul
	1. NEBuffer 2 (10x) (B7002S)					5.0 ul
	2. dATP (10mM)						1.0 ul
	3. Klenow Fragment (3’ -> 5’ exo-) (NEB M0212L)*thaw on ice*		2.0 ul

2. Incubate at 37°C for 60 mins

3. Ligate the P2 adapter to the fragments by adding the following reagents to the sample *in order*. Total volume is 50 ul
	1. NEBuffer 2 (10x) (B7002S)					5.0 ul
	2. P2 RAD adapter (10 uM) [annealed]			1.0 ul
	3. rATP (100 mM, Fermentas R0441)				0.5 ul
	4. T4 DNA Ligase (NEB M0202M)* thaw on ice*				0.5 ul


4. Incubate at 20ºC for 30 min
