Step by step - denaturing your library and loading it into the MiSeq

1.- Prepare a fresh dilution of NaOH
       2 uL of 2.0 N NaOH
       18 uL PCR water

2.- Denature your LIBRARY
        5 uL of 4nM LIBRARY
        5 uL 0.2N NaOH

        Mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min

        Add 990 uL of HT1 buffer: you have 1ml of 20pM library

3.- Choose your final concentration: 12pM is a good starting point for a V3 kit. I'll do 8 pM this time
as I am using a v2 Kit.
Mix:
240uL pf 20pM LIBRARY
360uL of HT1

4.- In this case, I'll skip denaturing and dilution of PHIX - It was already made. If you have to do it from scratch:

Mix:
2 uL PhiX Stock
3 uL Tween20 buffer
5 uL 0.2N NaOH

      Mix well, let it incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes

      Add 990 uL of HT1 buffer: you have 1ml of 20pM PHIX. If you are using v3. stop here. if using a V2 kit, dilute to 12pM

Mix:

375 uL PhiX 20pM
225 uL HT1


5.- Spike in 5% of PHIX.
    Mix: 30 uL 20pm PHIX
        570 uL 8pm Library
