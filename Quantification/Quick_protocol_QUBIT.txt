Qubit Standard 2

Equipment

P1000
P200
p10

clear 200ul tubes

1.- Calculate the  number of reactions needed:
n= number of samples + 2 standards
2.- Prepare the Qubit MIx :
Qubit Buffer: 199ul * n
Qubit Reagent: n ul
      Mix throughly

3.- Prepare the 2 standards by mixing
190 ul Qubit MIX
10 ul of Standard

4.- Prepare the samples by mixing
190-199 ul of Qubit mix (198 Would be my call)
10-1 ul of sample (2 ul as before)

5.- Vortex each trouble and let them sit for 2 min for the RX to happen

6.- Run the Qubit ds DNA High Sensitivity Test:
a) Standard 1
b) St 2
c) Each sample. On the first one, use the Calculate the stock concentration option
to see what conversion factor you have to do from the reading in the tube to the original
DNA concentration
